GTFSVTOR
========

An open-source GTFS validator, released under GPLv3.
See the [LICENSE file](LICENSE) for more information.

- Fast
- Extensible
- Extensive coverage

How to use GTFSVTOR
-------------------

GTFSVTOR is still beta, but should be usable as-is.
Only the following tables are loaded:
`agency.txt, routes.txt, calendar.txt, calendar_dates.txt, trips.txt, stop_times.txt, shapes.txt, transfers.txt, fare_attributes.txt, fare_rules.txt`.
Not all validation rules of the legacy feedvalidator.py are implemented, however.
See the [TODO](TODO) file to check what rules are missing.

You can browse this [example report](https://mecatran.github.io/gtfsvtor/validation-report.html) to see the validation result of the "verybad" dataset.

For now, as there are no released bundle, you must compile the validator yourself:

- Download the source code
- Install gradle
- Run `gradle assemble` in the root directory of the project
- Unzip the generated zip file (`gtfsvtor.zip` in `build/distributions`)
- Run gtfsvtor:

    ./bin/gtfsvtor --help
    ./bin/gtfsvtor [options] <GTFS file>

A sample config.properties file is included in the root of the project
if you want to configure the validation.

Performances
------------

Performance tests are done using:

- in-memory option (-m) enabled for feedvalidator.py
- duplicate trips detection option (-d) disabled for feedvalidator.py
- small memory-footprint GtfsStopTime implementation enabled for GTFSVTOR

**Note**: Performances comparisons are not 100% accurate as GTFSVTOR do not have all validators implemented.
However most of the CPU-intensive work is implemented in GTFSVOR as the time of writing
(loading and conversion of stops, trips, times, shapes, calendars; shape linear indexing; calendar indexing;
stop spatial indexing; too fast travel checks, trip duplication detection, block ID overlap...)

Developer guide
---------------

**TODO**

- Code documentation
- Configuration
- Adding new validation rules
- Using GTFSVTOR as a library
